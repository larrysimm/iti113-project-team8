### iti113-project-team8

Developing a machine learning model to predict the next word a user types.
This project involves building and training a predictive text model and deploying it as a real-time, scalable service using AWS SageMaker.
The goal is to create a fast and accurate text suggestion engine to improve user experience.
For dataset, we choose from https://huggingface.co/datasets/Yuti/bookcorpus/viewer/default/train?p=1 but we only use the 1st 10000 line of text.
